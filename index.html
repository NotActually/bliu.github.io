                <p>My name is Jason and im currently an 2nd year Software Engineering major at the University of California, Irvine. Disclaimer: I'm not as serious as I appear to be in the picture.
                  Im from Chino Hills, CA and moved there in 2011 during my junior year of highschool. My interest for technology came about after jailbreaking my IPad first generation. 
                  The amount of additional features you could install blew my mind as a 7th grader. I would eventually start to realize these jailbreak features were created by computer developers</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>After taking an introduction to C++ course in high school, writing simple code with endless possibilities ingrained my love for technology. 
                  It brought me to where I am now. After participating in highschool swim team and a robotics club in high school I found that I love with working with others
                  in order to acheive your goals. Working alongside others and Designing creative solutions are what I do best in.

              Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
